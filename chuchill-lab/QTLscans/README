Run QTLscans:
- Additive model
- Age interactive model
- Sex interactive model

Within each model are two directories for mRNA and protein, and within them are:
(mrna example)

- `XXXXX_all_m.py` : This scripts creates `XXXXX_all_m.sh` which will run multiple qsubs based on batch size

- `XXXXX_all_m.sh`: This script should be run with `bash XXXXX_all_m.sh`, which will start submitting multiple qsub to scan QTLs.

- `XXXXX_one_m.sh`: Script that will run Rscript below

- `XXXXX_one_m.R` : Contains script using R/qtl2 to scan for model.
